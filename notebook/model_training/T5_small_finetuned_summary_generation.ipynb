are the days when Eileen Dover was considered an unfortunate name, with celebrity culture booming like never before, sharing a name with a star can be pretty unlucky, too. Something that New York resident Beyoncé knows about all too well. No, not the legendary singer but another woman who says having the same name as the wife of Jay-Z has caused her grief her entire life. Humans of New York photographer shared this image of a NY resident whose name is Beyoncé. The photo was accompanied by a statement from her describing the inconvenience of sharing a celebrity name . In a post that has now gone viral on Facebook, Beyonce says: 'Sometimes I hate my name because it always draws attention to me, and I'm not a very social person. 'My family moved this year from Pennsylvania. I was so scared the first day of school that someone would notice me. I wouldn't even adjust my seat because I thought it would make a noise. One time I really had to cough, but I held it in. This was followed with thousands of Facebook comments from users who suffer from the very same problem . All expressed their shared pain with Beyoncé after living with unfortunate name clashes . Although this Kaity Perry has inherited an extra 'i' it hasn't prevented her from being the butt of the jokes . 'When the teacher started calling attendance, I got really nervous, because every time people learn my name is Beyoncé, somebody starts singing Single Ladies. And some did, of course. But the second day of school wasn't too bad. Because everyone knew my name.' Her photo was posted on Facebook accompanied with this statement as part of the Humans of New York project. The photo series was created by photographer Brandon Stanton who travels around the city capturing images of its residents and sharing their stories. As well as joint celebrity names users expressed their annoyance at sharing names with famous songs . And then there was gaining an embarrassing name through marriage . Tanya's name became slightly more awkward after her career saw her gain a new title .

Can't introduce myself that 2 minutes after people are singing and dancing! And they think they're the first ones to make the connection :P I just try to laugh about it, if it helps :)' (sic) Carolina Ahs gained her bad name once married: 'I was once married; My last name is Ahs, his Hull. We were the Ahs-Hulls...' Tanya Boob Kluck said: 'Beyoncé isn't bad! Try having the last name Boob, and then join the Army as a Private. Yes, Private Boob!'

Manchester City sniffing around with their millions, looking to prize away some of Arsene Wenger's finest talent. Jack Wilshere is the latest man linked with a switch to the Etihad Stadium, where he would follow the likes of Emmanuel Adebayor, Bacary Sagna and Samir Nasri who swapped London for the North-West as City stormed towards Premier League and FA Cup glory. But times have changed. The Gunners are now ahead of City in the table and appear to be a club on the up, while the men from Manchester must rebuild. And if £30million or more is truly on the table for Wilshere, Arsenal must consider it. Manchester CIty are considering making a move for Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere this summer . Wilshere hasn't played for the first team since injuring his ankle against Manchester United in November . Alexis Sanchez cost Arsenal £30m, while Chelsea splashed out roughly the same amount to bring in Diego Costa. Those two forwards have a combined total of 33 league goals this season. And for all Wilshere's many talents, he would not be a game changer for Manuel Pellegrini, or whoever City's manager may be next season. He was touted as a future Arsenal and England midfielder when he burst onto the scene, showing the world what he can do in a Champions League tie against Barcelona, and possesses a technical ability which wouldn't see him out of place at the Nou Camp. His quick movement, superb touch and low centre of gravity is perfect for the sharp, driving style of play manager Wenger likes at the Emirates Stadium, as Wilshere's goal of the season against Norwich last season perfectly demonstrated. He has been doubted on several occasions, partly because of his lifestyle off the pitch, in the most part because of his treacherous injury record at the age of 23. The midfielder has picked up a total of 24 knocks during his seven-year professional career. He was tipped as a future Arsenal star and England international when he broke through the ranks in 2008 . Wilshere is only 23 years old but has picked up 24 separate injuries during his professional career . But even as recently as this season, Wilshere was hitting form before going off against Manchester United. He was certainly more impressive than Aaron Ramsey and Santi Cazorla in the Arsenal midfield, and impressed for England in a deep-lying role. There now seems to be little space for the Stevenage-born schemer to fit in this starting XI. Ramsey, Cazorla, Sanchez, Francis Coquelin, and Mesut Ozil played behind Olivier Giroud in the recent thumping victory over Liverpool, and that's without the likes of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Tomas Rosicky, Theo Walcott and Danny Welbeck involved. Of course, the ideal state of play would be for Wenger to build a team around Wilshere, a man who is signed on for three more years, and not to consider any bids from divisional rivals at least. But Arsenal would be foolish to dismiss anything over £30m in today's market, especially considering the kind of players Wenger can now attract to the club. Wilshere impressed in a holding role for England in an international friendly against Scotland last year . He was in form before ankle surgery, scoring a fine goal against Manchester City in September . The midfielder fired past Brad Guzan to score the opening goal against Aston Villa last season . Wilshere's effort against Norwich was voted the 2013-14 Premier League Goal of the Season . Arsenal's relationship with City, who the club have never held a firm rivalry with, could also play a part. Any interest from fellow top-four clubs Chelsea or Manchester United would probably be dismissed immediately. The current Premier League champions are looking to rebuild under Sheik Mansour and need homegrown, young players to freshen up an ageing side. Wilshere is seen as a possibility along with Jordan Henderson in midfield. Raheem Sterling and Paul Pogba have also been linked with a summer transfer, with Nasri and Yaya Toure among many names who could leave. But with Liverpool set to hand Henderson the captain's armband after Steven Gerrard's departure, his stay would seem more likely despite his contract running down at Anfield. Arsenal fans would hate to see Wilshere go and he encapsulates the style at the Emirates. However, for a man who has scored five goals in his league career, and one who would not neccessarily push on close rivals to better things, it may be worth thinking about. Jordan Henderson is also a possibility for Manchester City as the club look for homegrown youngsters .\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nManchester City considering bid for Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere .\nJordan Henderson is also an option for the Premier League champions .\nWilshere, 23, encapsulates Arsene Wenger's style of play in north London .\nBut the England international is not necessarily a first-team regular .\nAny bids in excess of £30m should be considered by Arsenal .\n\n\n====================================================================================================\nShe's a best-selling singer, actress, fashion designer, beauty buff and one of the world's best connected stars.

The collection, which is also inspired by Rita's passion for music, is full of long-lasting lip glosses and high shine polishes in the rainbow hued colours that Rita loves. Rocking a red lip and beachy, tousled hair, Rita proves she can cut it as a model as she showcases her cleavage in a Brian Litchenberg  graffiti-emblazoned crop top . Rita also recently unveiled her own festival-inspired range, Rimmel: Colourfest Lip and Nail Collection by Rita Ora, for the beauty giant . As well as conquering the beauty world, Rita partied with fashion's finest at Tommy Hilfiger's new store opening and dinner party that followed in Paris, France, on Tuesday night. Rita's rapper beau Ricky, son of the legendary designer, smartened up for the occasion, ditching his usual emo jumpers and baggy jeans for a grey suit. The green-haired star happily posed alongside his girlfriend, who set off her look with a top-knot and a slick of deep red lipstick. Rita partied with fashion's finest at Tommy Hilfiger's new store opening and dinner party that followed in Paris, France, on Tuesday night with her boyfriend Ricky . Rita and Ricky's romance has been going from strength-to-strength since they met last summer and the pair reportedly moved in together in January. The Voice UK coach showed no sign of her recent disappointment after losing her two remaining acts, Karis and Joe, during the semi-final of the BBC One singing competition last weekend. The pop starlet is the only coach going into the final with no acts. Kaiser Chiefs frontman Ricky Wilson was the only mentor to get both of his acts - Emmanuel and Stevie - into the final, while Will.i.am and Sir Tom both have a contestant in the running to be crowned the winner of series four. Rita's own collection is also inspired by her passion for music, with one polish in her range fittingly being named 'Glastonberry'\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRita, 24, models in colourful new Rimmel beauty campaign .\nStar has also designed her own make-up collection for brand .\nPartied in Paris last night with boyfriend Ricky Hilfiger .\n\n\n====================================================================================================\nSandro has defended former manager Harry Redknapp, saying he is not at fault for QPR’s predicament near the foot of the Premier League.

Sandro has defended former manager Harry Redknapp, saying he is not at fault for QPR’s predicament . Redknapp branded the situation at QPR a ‘soap opera’ and accused people of working against him . But Brazilian midfielder Sandro said that Redknapp, who brought him to the club for £10million at the start of the season, should not shoulder all the blame, despite leaving the club second from bottom in the table, where they have continued to struggle under stand-in manager Chris Ramsey. ‘I don’t think it’s fair to blame him,’ he said. ‘I’m never going to put everything on the coach or the players, it is half and half because everyone has to pull together. If we don’t stay up it’s not Chris’s fault, not just our fault, it’s everyone together. Redknapp said he felt he would have kept Rangers in the Premier League next season if he were still in charge in west London. Some players blame QPR's slump on Redknapp’s recruitment during the summer transfer window . The QPR midfielder controls the ball during a training session on Friday . They may yet climb out of the drop zone under Ramsey after a 4-1 victory over West Bromwich Albion and a rollercoaster 3-3 draw with Aston Villa left them two points from safety. Sandro said he has seen a change in the mentality of his team-mates and thinks they can overcome league leaders Chelsea on Sunday. ‘Everyone, I can see in their face they want to fight, everyone is trying their best to stay up. Everyone now is a leader and makes a difference,’ he said.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSandro insists he doesn't blame Harry Redknapp for QPR's struggles .\nRedknapp left the Premier League side in February citing knee problems .\nQPR midfielder claims it's 'not fair' to blame his former boss .\n\n\n====================================================================================================\nA Disney World employee allegedly inappropriately touched himself in a Walmart store and then threw bodily fluids over an unsuspecting female shopper.

Viewer Hardy Lion tweeted: '#bbcbreakfast ha ha spelt education wrong!!! Back to school!' Back to school: Eagle-eyed viewers spotted Charlie Stayt's embarrassing spelling error during a live broadcast . The presenter left out the letter 'c' when he wrote the word for the third time on the whiteboard this morning . The presenter later described the gaffe as 'one of those things,' after being alerted  to it by colleagues . Whilst Mike Knowles tweeted: 'If you're presenting a live report about education on #BBCBreakfast maybe double check how you spell education.' Viewer John Morley added: 'Fantastic, #bbcbreakfast presenter can't spell education.' Crafty Monkey wrote: '@BBCBreakfast C-!! Could do better!' Afterwards, Bill Turnbull told Stayt he had started a Twitter frenzy and made him spell out the word education live on air. He said: 'There we go, it was a typo, we'll forgive him.' Presenter Sally Nugent added: 'I don't think that spelling mistake was that bad.' Stayt said: 'Let's just call it one of those things.' But Turnbull added: 'You've only caused a Twitter frenzy in two-and-a-half minutes.' Nugent said: 'I don't think anyone's noticed.' Stayt was discussing the issue of education at Highfield Primary School as part of the programme's UK sofa tour in the run up to the election. Blunder: Stayt was broadcasting from Highfield Primary School in Southampton, Hampshire . Afterwards, colleague Bill Turnbull made red-faced Stayt spell the word 'education' US politician Dan Quayle was mocked when he misspelt the word 'potato' on a school blackboard on June 15, 1992 when he was visiting a school in Trenton as part of his official duties. He took part in a spelling bee when students had to write words on a blackboard. When it was 12-year-old William Figueroa's turn he had to write the word 'potato'. But Quayle pointed out: 'You're close, but you left a little something off. The e on the end'. In December last year, police in South Yorkshire were left embarrassed after taking delivery of a new patrol car with POLCE emblazoned on the side. In April 2013, council workmen somehow managed to spell 'school' wrong outside Innellan Primary School, near Dunoon in Scotland. They painted 'sckool' on the road instead. Bungling workers were slammed in February 2013 in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, after they put up a sign for a historic Welsh bridge - but misspelled it 'Whelsh'. In March 2012, Oxfordshire council workers misspelled 'SCHOOL' as 'SCHOUL' in traffic markings outside Wolverton Primary School. A sign made by Hertfordshire Highways in February 2012 instructed motorists to 'Keer Cleap'.\",\n 'summary': \"Charlie Stayt made the error during live broadcast from Southampton .\\nBBC presenter
